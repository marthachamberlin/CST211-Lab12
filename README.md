Sorting

Description

Write the following sorts: 
* Brute Force Bubble, 
* Flagged Bubble, 
* Selection, 
* Insertion, 
* Shell, 
* Heap (iterative), 
* Merge (recursive), and 
* Quick (recursive).

Use command line arguments to get the total number of records to sort. This will become n.

Create and randomly fill an array with integers. 
Use this same array of data for each sorting algorithm. 
Make sure to reset the array(s) back to the original data after each sort so that you are comparing the algorithms on the same data set.

Measure the time it takes, using chrono, for each sort to complete its sorting routine. 
Write the sort name and the time it took to complete to the screen as well as a file. 
Print every 1000th element to the output file so it is easier to see that the sort worked.

Use C-Arrays (native arrays), vector class, and your array class as containers. Run the program and store the results in a text file in the solution.

Extra Credit
* Radix sort - 10 pts
* Shaker sort - 10 pts
* Iterative quick sort - 10 pts

Deliverables
One file including:
Your code (at least for the required sorts)
Your test(s) similar to Lab1_test.cpp & Lab2_test.cpp and their results for whatever code you deliver.
